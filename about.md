### ABOUT ME 🙋🏻

Greetings, my name is Hyunwoo Kim, an aspiring XR developer from Seoul, Korea.

Becoming proficient in VR was a task that indisputably came with a plethora of trials and tribulations. My friend and I initiated this endeavor from scratch in a small studio apartment. However, I am deeply appreciative of every moment from the beginning to the end. Without such experience, I wouldn’t be the person I am today.

I now work on a VR game called **RealVRFishing** 🎣.

I am always thrilled to acquire more knowledge and strive for excellence in this field. I am a team player and enjoy human connections. \
I welcome you on my journey to becoming an enthusiastic XR developer.
